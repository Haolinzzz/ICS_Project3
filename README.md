## What is a space probe?

According to Natiaonal Geography, a space probe is an unpiloted, unmanned device sent to explore space and gather scientific information. A space probe is launched from Earth with a set of scientific instruments and tools used to study the atmosphere and composition of space and other planets, moons, or celestial bodies. A probe may operate far out in space, or it may orbit or land on a planet or a moon. It may make a one-way journey, or it may bring samples and data back to Earth. 

## What's new?

1. Comparing to the first project, which only have the Earth and Mars, I introduced Venus in to the system and the project has potential to add any new planet or any celestial bodies.
2. Instead of using the wikipedia, all data are directly imported from the NASA.
